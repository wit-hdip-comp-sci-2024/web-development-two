# Exercises 

If you want to download a complete version of the app as it should be at the end of this lab, then create a new Glitch project by cloning this repo:

- <https://github.com/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2023/playlist-1.git>

## Exercise 1: Run the app

Import and run the sample solution above.

## Exercise 2:  Extend Views

Extend the following views:

- Dashboard: Extend the Dashboard view to contain some simple statement about how to use the application.
- About: Extend the about view to provide contact details (may be fictitious) for the author/company that created the app.


## Exercise 3:  Let's try and understand

OK, so there's actually a lot here and if you've gotten through it without any issues you probably missed a lot of learning "opportunities".

So let's review what is going on.


### server.js

Open glitch and open server.js


```javascript
import express from "express";
import bodyParser from "body-parser";
import cookieParser from "cookie-parser";
import fileUpload from "express-fileupload";
import { engine } from "express-handlebars";
import { router } from "./routes.js";

const app = express();
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(express.static("public"));
app.use(fileUpload());
app.engine(".hbs", engine({ extname: ".hbs" }));
app.set("view engine", ".hbs");
app.set("views", "./views");
app.use("/", router);

const listener = app.listen(process.env.PORT || 4000, function () {
  console.log(`Todolist started on http://localhost:${listener.address().port}`);
});
```

You can consider a lot of this as "boilerplate" but look for the console that log that says we have started on a certain port.  You probably noticed this in the logs and it is good go know where this has come from.

Second, see the line `app.use("/", router);`.  This is telling the application that once someone hits your URL, use the router defined as `router`, i.e. `import { router } from "./routes.js";`


### routes.js

Alright, take a look in `routes.js`.

```javascript
import express from "express";
import { dashboardController } from "./controllers/dashboard-controller.js";
import { aboutController } from "./controllers/about-controller.js";

export const router = express.Router();

router.get("/", dashboardController.index);
router.get("/dashboard", dashboardController.index);
router.get("/about", aboutController.index);
router.post("/dashboard/addplaylist", dashboardController.addPlaylist);
```

On this line `router.get("/", dashboardController.index);`, we define that when someone hits the root URL, we should call the `index` method on the `dashboardController`.

OK, let's take a look at the `dashboardController` and specifically the `index` method.

### dashboard-controller.js

```javascript
import { playlistStore } from "../models/playlist-store.js"

export const dashboardController = {
  async index(request, response) {
    const viewData = {
      title: "Playlist 1 Dashboard",
      playlists: await playlistStore.getAllPlaylists()
    };
    console.log("dashboard rendering");
    response.render("dashboard-view", viewData);
  },
```

Here you can see the `dashboard rendering` log that you may have seen in your console.

Here, we are defining viewData, pulling data our of our data store and then called `response.render("dashboard-view", viewData);` which is rendering the view `dashboard-view` with the data `viewData`.

This passes our data to the view and renders it.

### dashboard-view.hbs

```html
{{> menu active="dashboard"}}

<section class="section">
  {{> list-playlists}}
  {{> add-playlist}}
</section>
```

Now we are finally at the view, I hope you can see that we have gone from the server, to the router, to the controller and now to the view.

This view is made up of two partials, `list-playlists` and `add-playlist`, and also the menu partial at the top.

If you take a look at list-playlists.hbs 

```html
{{#each playlists}}
<div class="box box-link-hover-shadow">
  <h2 class="title">
    {{title}}
  </h2>
</div>
{{/each}}
```

You can see we are iterating over `playlists`.

But where did this come from????

Try to figure that out before looking below.


Don't cheat!

Did you figure it out?

Cmon, give it a try!

OK, I'll tell you.

Back in the `dashboard-controller.js` we have this:

```javascript
import { playlistStore } from "../models/playlist-store.js"

export const dashboardController = {
  async index(request, response) {
    const viewData = {
      title: "Playlist 1 Dashboard",
      playlists: await playlistStore.getAllPlaylists()
    };
    console.log("dashboard rendering");
    response.render("dashboard-view", viewData);
  },
```

See that `viewData` has a property `playlists` that is set to `await playlistStore.getAllPlaylists()`. 

This is where list-playlists is getting its data from.  See if you can make sense of that before moving on with your life.

The main thing is to get the flow of the data and the hierarchy of the partials and the views.  There's a lot of places to get tied in knots.  I'd recommend a pencil and paper to draw out the flow of data and the hierarchy of the views and partials.  Been there and done that!
