Time to check the git log. Run the following command:

```bash
git log
```

You should see the commit history. The commit history shows the commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

```bash

To exit this view, press `q`.

Now let's create a branch. Run the following command:

```bash
git branch my-first-branch
```

Switch to the new branch by running the following command:

```bash
git checkout my-first-branch
```

Note that you can combine the above two commands into one by running the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b my-first-branch
```

Where the checkout command is followed by the `-b` flag and the name of the new branch. This will create the new branch and switch to it. This is the command I use most of the time when creating branches.

Run the `git branch` command to see the branches. You should see the main branch and the new branch.

Now run git status:

```bash
git status
```

```bash
git status
On branch my-first-branch
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Now switch back to the main branch by running the following command:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Now run git status:

```bash
git status
```

```bash
git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Now switch back to the new branch by running the following command:

```bash
git checkout my-first-branch
```

Note that with newer versions of git, you can use the following command to switch branches:

```bash
git switch my-first-branch
```

Or to switch back to the main branch:

```bash
git switch main
```

Or you can switch to the last branch you were on by running the following command:

```bash
git switch -
```

OK, make sure you are on the new branch by running the following command:

```bash
git status
```

Create a new file called `file3.txt` (feel free to use do it via a text editor if you prefer) by running the following command:

```bash
echo "# File 3" > file3.txt
```

Now check the status of the repository:

```bash
git status
```

Now add the new file to the staging area:

```bash
git add file3.txt
```

Now commit the new file:

```bash
git commit -m "Add file3.txt"
```

Now, ensure you have the terminal on the left hand side of your screen and your file explorer on the right as suggested at the start of this lab and switch back to the main branch by running the following command:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Notice what has happened in the file explorer. The file `file3.txt` has disappeared. This is because the file is only in the new branch. Switch back to the new branch by running the following command:

```bash
git checkout my-first-branch
```

The file is back!

Alright, back to main and merge the new branch into the main branch by running the following command:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge my-first-branch
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
git merge my-first-branch
Updating bd8d505..0047766
Fast-forward
 file3.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 file3.txt
```

Check the git log. You should see the new commit from the branch.

Now since we have merged the branch, we can delete it by running the following command:

```bash
git branch -d my-first-branch
```

Run the command `git branch` to see the branches. You should only see the main branch.
