# .gitignore

Head back to `my-first-repo` and create a file called `my-secret-file.txt`:

```bash
echo "This is a secret file with a password or key" > my-secret-file.txt
```

Check the status of the repository:

```bash
git status
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
git status
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	my-secret-file.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Now, this is a file we do not want to track. We can tell git to ignore this file by creating a `.gitignore` file. This file will contain a list of files and directories that git should ignore.

Create a file called `.gitignore`:

```bash
echo "my-secret-file.txt" > .gitignore
```

Check the status of the repository:

```bash
git status
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
git status
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

You can see that my-secret-file.txt is no longer listed as an untracked file. This is because we have told git to ignore it.

BUT, you can see that `.gitignore` is now listed as an untracked file. We need to add this file to the staging area and commit it.

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore file"
```

Check the status of the repository:

```bash
git status
```
