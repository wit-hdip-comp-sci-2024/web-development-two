# git and github

Follow the instructions in the Git and Github notes (talk 3 on tutors) and it will walk you through the process of signing up for a github account, configuring git, and creating a new repository.

Step through the authorization process.

The lecture video is long enough so if you get through that and work alongside, you should be able to get through the process.
