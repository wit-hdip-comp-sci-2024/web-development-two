# Multiple files

Create two new files in the directory called `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`. Put the following text in `file1.txt`:

```markdown
# File 1
```

Put the following text in `file2.txt`:

```markdown
# File 2
```

You can do that via your text editor or run the following commands:

```bash
echo "# File 1" > file1.txt
echo "# File 2" > file2.txt
```

Now check the status of the repository:

```bash
git status
```

You should see the 2 new files.

Now add both of these files via

```bash
git add -A
```

Check the status again:

```bash
git status
```

You should see that the files are now staged.

Now commit the files:

```bash
git commit -m "Add file1.txt and file2.txt"
```

Check the status again:

```bash
git status
```

## Editing multiple files

Now, let's edit both files either via a text editor or via the terminal.

Now check the status.

```bash
git status
```

```bash
git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   file1.txt
	modified:   file2.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Now we can jump past the staging area and commit the changes directly.

```bash
git commit -a -m "Edit file1.txt and file2.txt"
```

Now verify the status.
