# Sessions

You should now be able to sign up and log in. Try the following:

-  Create two users
-  Log in with each user in turn and create some sample playlists
- Log out back in, taking note of the playlists each user has accumulated

You may notice that, regardless of which user logs in, the same playlists are always displayed. We need to revise the dashboard-controller in small by significant ways in order to correct this.

First, let us note this method we already have defined in the accounts-controller:

### controllers/accounts-controller.js

~~~javascript
  async getLoggedInUser(request) {
    const userEmail = request.cookies.playlist;
    return await userStore.getUserByEmail(userEmail);
  },
~~~

If a user is logged in (i.e. a cookie has been set), we can retrieve the users email from the cookie, and locate that user in the user-store.

Next, we need a new method for the playlist-store:

### models/playlist-store.js

~~~javascript
...
  async getPlaylistsByUserId(userid) {
    await db.read();
    return db.data.playlists.filter((playlist) => playlist.userid === userid);
  },
...
~~~

This method attempts to retrieve only playlists inserted with a specific "userid".

We can now refine key methods in the dasboard-controller to distinguish between playlists created by different users

#### controllers/dashboard-controller.js

~~~javascript
import { accountsController } from "./accounts-controller.js";
...
  async index(request, response) {
    const loggedInUser = await accountsController.getLoggedInUser(request);
    const viewData = {
      title: "Playlist Dashboard",
      playlists: await playlistStore.getPlaylistsByUserId(loggedInUser._id),
    };
    console.log("dashboard rendering");
    response.render("dashboard-view", viewData);
  },
...
  async addPlaylist(request, response) {
    const loggedInUser = await accountsController.getLoggedInUser(request);
    const newPlayList = {
      title: request.body.title,
      userid: loggedInUser._id,
    };
    console.log(`adding playlist ${newPlayList.title}`);
    await playlistStore.addPlaylist(newPlayList);
    response.redirect("/dashboard");
  }, 
...
~~~

In both of these methods our first task is to identify who is currently logged in, and then:

- When displaying all playlists, only retrieve the lists for the logged user
- When creating a playlist, make sure to insert the userid of the current user into the playlist.

Restart the app and create some playlists as different users. Verify that you are only able to see the playlists associated with the user who created them.
