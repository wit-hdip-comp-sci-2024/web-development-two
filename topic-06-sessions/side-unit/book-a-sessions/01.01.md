# Start

Use the project from the last lab as the basis for this lab. This is available here:

- <https://github.com/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2023/playlist-3>

For this lab, you can use either Glitch or VScode, whichever you find more convenient or appealing.

- Glitch: the application is always running (if free of errors), and always deployed publicly
- VSCode: the app is only running locally. However, you can debug the application if you become familiar with the VSCode debug interface

You could do a hybrid of both. Use VSCode for each lab. At the labs conclusion, see if you can get the project onto Github, and import to Glitch from there. In this way you are deploying the app.

Once you have the application set up, change the application name to from Playlist 3 to Playlist 4 in the following locations:

- views/partial/brand.hbs
- views/about-view.hbs
