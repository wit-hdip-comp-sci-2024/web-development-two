If you want to download a complete version of the app as it should be at the end of this lab, then create a new Glitch project by importing this repo:

- <https://github.com/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2023/playlist-4.git>

Alternatively, clone the project

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2023/playlist-4.git
~~~

Then change into the folder, run "npm install" and "npm run start".

~~~bash
cd playlist-2
npm install
npm run start
~~~

You can then open the folder in VSCode. 

Alternatively :

- Clone the repo
- Open VSCode
- In VScode, launch a "Terminal"
- In the terminal, enter:

~~~bash
cd playlist-2
npm install
npm run start
~~~
