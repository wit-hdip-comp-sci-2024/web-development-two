# Test the Algorithm

The appropriate place to call the algorithm could be just before we display the playlist in the playlist controller index method. It looks like this currently:

### controllers/playlist-controller.js

~~~java
  async index(request, response) {
    const playlist = await playlistStore.getPlaylistById(request.params.id);
    const viewData = {
      title: "Playlist",
      playlist: playlist,
    };
    response.render("playlist-view", viewData);
  },
~~~

Here is a revision:

~~~java
  async index(request, response) {
    const playlist = await playlistStore.getPlaylistById(request.params.id);

    let shortestTrack = null;
    if (playlist.tracks.length > 0) {
      shortestTrack = playlist.tracks[0];
      for (let i = 1; i < playlist.tracks.length; i++) {
        if (playlist.tracks[i].duration < shortestTrack.duration) {
          shortestTrack = playlist.tracks[i];
        }
      }
    }
    console.log(shortestTrack);

    const viewData = {
      title: "Playlist",
      playlist: playlist,
    };
    response.render("playlist-view", viewData);
  },
~~~

Run this now. It doesn't display anything on the view - however we are logging the shortest track to the console:

~~~bash
{
  title: 'Piano Sonata No. 10',
  artist: 'Beethoven',
  _id: '0e70b453-ce7f-47e5-a0a0-9f3f5565353f',
  duration: 4
}
~~~

Visit each of the different playlists and verify that the correct shortest track being listed.
